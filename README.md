# Harmonic Standard Model

An empirical exploration into hidden harmonic structure within Standard Model particle masses.

This repository contains the code, data, and figures for a six-parameter framework that predicts 14 of 15 fundamental particle masses using only quark data.

## Why this exists

This project began from an amateur investigation into structure in particle masses. I have no formal training in quantum field theory and no institutional backing. I simply noticed a pattern—and followed it.

The results presented here are likely incomplete, and may contain mistakes I cannot resolve alone. This work could very likely be improved significantly with help from domain experts.

Until then, this is the best I could get it.

## What's here

- `first_try_stress_test.py`: correlation tests, parameter validation, boson predictions
- `quark_plots.py`: 2D vs 3D residuals and helix structure figures
- `energy_matter_spiral.py`: harmonic placement of particles across energy space
